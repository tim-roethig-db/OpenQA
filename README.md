# OpenQA
The idea is to create a Quality Assurance suite for git repositories (python only initially).

## Features
1. AI Agent that automatically sets up the environment and installs dependencies
2. Code Format check using black
3. Linting using pyling
4. LLM based linting fixes
5. LLM generated tests using hypothesis to spot errors
